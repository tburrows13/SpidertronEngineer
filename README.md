Spidertron Engineer
==================

Are you tired of walking around on only 2 legs? Now you can live your whole life as a hulking 8-legged spider mech!

You can see Xterminator's Mod Spotlight here:

Major Features
-----

- Spawn from the start as a Spidertron (with no way to exit it!*)
- Starting Spidertron stats are adjusted to be comparable to a normal engineer
- Reworked military and armor research technologies to add weapons, armor, inventory and equipment grid slots to the Spidertron instead
    - For example, when the Modular Armor research is completed, 10 inventory slots, a small equipment grid, increased health and resistances, and physical size increases are applied directly to all players (thank you to [Qon](https://forums.factorio.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=16047) for the help with size scaling!)
- Optional space science rework (thank you to [Polsefel](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/ii5k95/altf4_2_spidertron/g34mf8l) for the suggestion)
    - Launch spidertrons into space instead of satellites to obtain space science packs (a spidertron does cost ~3x that of a satellite, but the difference is small compared to the total cost of all the rocket parts)
    - Reclaim fish from the rocket either directly or by converting space science into fish
- Optionally spawn with a spidertron remote configured to control your own Spidertron Engineer, allowing point-and-click movement
- Heal surrounding buildings by emitting a repair pack as a repair cloud

*There is a setting that allows you to exit the Spidertron. This allows some features from other mods to work, such as entering a factory in [Factorissimo2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2)

-----
Other Info
-----

- Supports multiplayer, including different forces/factions
- Can be added or removed from existing saves at any time (but items and equipment stored in the Spidertron Engineer will be lost!)
- The whole Spidertron Engineer can fit inside trains and carriages (just press *Enter* next to one)
- Vanilla Spidertron is untouched and can be unlocked and used remotely as usual
- Upon death, all item's in the player's inventory are placed in the player's corpse as usual and all item's from the Spidertron Engineer are spilled onto the ground around the corpse
- Use `/create-spidertron playername` command if a player is left without a spidertron because of a mod incompatibility (such as respawning in Space Exploration)
- Player reach increased by 3 tiles to compensate for the fiddly movement of the spidertron

-----
Limitations
-----

- Can’t use repair packs on other entities
- Can only heal yourself with fish or construction robots - auto-healing is not properly supported by the API
- Personal roboports can only work with robots and items in the Spidertron trunk (probably will be fixed/improved after Factorio 1.1)

-----
Future Updates?
-----

- Tested and balanced mod compatibility, in particular: [Krastorio2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2), [Bob's Vehicle Equipment](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobvehicleequipment), [Spidertron Extended](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/spidertron-extended)
- Help needed: because I've never played any overhaul mods, it will be tricky for me to balance this mod to work with them. I'd appreciate suggestions about which technology researches to place upgrades at and which weapons/stats to have at each upgrade. I can happily go beyond the current 6 tiers if needed
- Better handling of player inventory vs spidertron inventory; see [this discussion](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpidertronEngineer/discussion/5f396ef22e266cbb298ccc2d). I'm waiting on Factorio 1.1, which will include a Spidertron logistics tab, before improving this further - it is heavily restricted by the mod API
