A list of things that would be nice to have (if they are possible), but I will probably never do myself, so they are not in the readme/description. PRs welcome!
- Improve visibility of Spidertron Engineer upgrades in tech tree
- Change item descriptions to reflect space science changes when those settings are active
- More configurable size changes
- Support for cannon shells
- Let path speed bonuses affect the Spidertron?
